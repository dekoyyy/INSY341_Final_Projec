To-do list for final project

- Create Firebase account for the project -- DONE

- Set up database correctly -- DONE 

- Create x recipes 
    -- Still have to add some 
        -- Generalize ingredients
              -- Change rotisserie chicken to chicken, so on 
              -- Maximize the number of common ingredients
    -- Need to have images for every ingredient
        -- Edit pictures so that they have all the same dimensions
        -- have a naming pattern so we can automatically generate the images we need
              -- all have the same extension
              -- have the same spelling as the name of the ingredient in Excel 
        
- Transform recipes in JSON objects -- DONE 

- Push JSON objects in firebase -- DONE 
    - possible either directly in the database, or via a function in the script 
    
- Create page to allow users to enter their recipes in the firebase database -- DONE
    - Dynamically create options with what is in the database -- DONE
        - Create array from database -- DONE
        - Remove duplicates from this array -- DONE
        - Fix bug that adds all options when you push something -- DONE
        - Set to selected/empty text input when saveData is done -- DONE
        - make the dropdown prettier with bootstrap -- DONEish 

- For the display of the images
      - Display one image at a time and have a button below that goes to the next ingredient -- DONE 
            - better than carousel as we'll be able to directly determine the size of the images   
            - change from text to image when we will have all the images done 
      - only displays when page is reloaded 

- Create function to get a recipe 
      - How it will work 
            - When page loads, images loads dynamically with all the different Ingredient 1. 
            - When selecting an Ingredient 1, narrows down to Ingredient 2 that have the Ingredient 1 selected
                  - If you choose chicken as Ingredient 1, only shows Ingredient 2 whose Ingredient 1 is chicken
            - When Ingredient 3 is chosen, hides images and shows the recipe link and recipe name
