- Fix bug with Carousel image so they fit properly 

- Create function to get a recipe 
      - How it will work 
            - When page loads, carousel loads dynamically with all the different Ingredient 1. 
            - When selecting an Ingredient 1, narrows down to Ingredient 2 that have the Ingredient 1 selected
                  - If you choose chicken as Ingredient 1, only shows Ingredient 2 whose Ingredient 1 is chicken
            - When Ingredient 3 is chosen, hides Carousel and shows the recipe link and recipe name 
            
- Create carousel dynamically
