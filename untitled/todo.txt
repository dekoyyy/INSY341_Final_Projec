- Create x recipes 
    -- Still have to add some 
        -- Generalize ingredients
              -- Change rotisserie chicken to chicken, so on 
              -- Maximize the number of common ingredients
    -- Need to have images for every ingredient
        -- Edit pictures so that they have all the same dimensions
        -- have a naming pattern so we can automatically generate the images we need
              -- all have the same extension
              -- have the same spelling as the name of the ingredient in Excel 
        
- Transform recipes in JSON objects -- DONE 

- Push JSON objects in firebase -- DONE 
    - possible either directly in the database, or via a function in the script

- For the display of the images
      - Display one image at a time and have a button below that goes to the next ingredient -- DONE 
            - better than carousel as we'll be able to directly determine the size of the images   
            - change from text to image when we will have all the images done

            - When selecting an Ingredient 1, narrows down to Ingredient 2 that have the Ingredient 1 selected -- DONE
                  - If you choose chicken as Ingredient 1, only shows Ingredient 2 whose Ingredient 1 is chicken
                  
            - When selecting an Ingredient 2, narrows down to Ingredient 3 that have the Ingredient 1 selected and Ingredient 2 selected -- DONE
                  - If you choose tomato as Ingredient 2, only shows Ingredient 3 whose Ingredient 1 is chicken and ingredient 2 is tomato
                  
            - When Ingredient 3 is chosen, hides images and shows the recipe link and recipe name
